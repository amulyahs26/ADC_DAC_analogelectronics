Advantages of Pipelined DACs:

Improved Speed: By handling portions of the conversion simultaneously, 
pipelined DACs achieve higher conversion rates compared to traditional 
serial converters.
Reduced Latency: The pipelined structure reduces the overall conversion 
time, enabling faster response in time-critical applications.
Scalability: Pipelined architectures can be scaled to achieve higher 
resolutions without a significant increase in conversion time.
Lower Power Consumption: Compared to other high-speed DAC 
architectures, pipelined DACs can offer relatively lower power 
consumption.

Applications:
Pipelined DACs find use in various applications demanding high-speed and 
high-resolution conversions, such as:
➢ Digital communication systems
➢ High-speed data acquisition
➢ Signal processing applications
